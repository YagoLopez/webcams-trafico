# Proposal: Install TailwindCSS

## Goal
Integrate TailwindCSS into the Expo project using NativeWind and create an example component to verify functionality.

## Why
Adopting TailwindCSS allows for a utility-first styling approach, enabling faster UI development, consistent design tokens, and better maintainability compared to traditional stylesheets.

## Success Criteria
- TailwindCSS and NativeWind dependencies are installed.
- `tailwind.config.js` and `global.css` are correctly configured.
- Babel/Metro configuration is updated for NativeWind support.
- A test component renders with Tailwind classes applied, confirming the integration works.
- The application builds and runs without styling errors.

## Impacted Capabilities
- `styling`: New capability for utility-first CSS styling.
