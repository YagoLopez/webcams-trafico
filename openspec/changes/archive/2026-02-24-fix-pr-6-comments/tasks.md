## 1. Unit Test Enhancements

- [x] 1.1 Update `components/__tests__/filters-modal.test.tsx` to query the relevant modal container elements using testing-library utilities.
- [x] 1.2 Add an assertion to verify the presence of `justify-center` and `items-center` in the `className` prop for the outer layout container.
- [x] 1.3 Add an assertion to verify the presence of `p-4` and `max-w-md` in the `className` prop for the inner modal container.
- [x] 1.4 Run the test suite (`npm run test:unit`) to confirm the `FiltersModal` tests pass successfully.
