## Context

The application currently relies on a statically built JSON file (`data/webcams.json`), which is generated by running `scripts/fetch-webcams.ts` offline. This approach results in stale webcam data as the script must be run manually or via a cron job. To ensure real-time access to the current list of remote webcams, we will migrate the fetching and parsing logic into a live API route (`get-remote-cams-data+api.ts`) using Expo Router. The API route will consume DGT's XML feed directly on demand and serve the required format.

## Goals / Non-Goals

**Goals:**
- Provide a robust live API endpoint within the Expo Router environment that dynamically fetches, parses, and returns webcam data.
- Retain the exact same data schema (`WebcamData`) expected by the frontend.
- Establish a responsive endpoint (re-using `axios` and `fast-xml-parser` as originally implemented).

**Non-Goals:**
- Implement caching or rate-limiting within the endpoint itself in this first iteration (it will hit the DGT XML source directly).
- Update the frontend fetching mechanism to point to this new API in this change (this change is strictly for creating the backend API route as requested).

## Decisions

- **File Placement**: In Expo Router, the API route will be placed under the `app` directory at `app/api/get-remote-cams-data+api.ts` so it serves requests to `/api/get-remote-cams-data` or `app/get-remote-cams-data+api.ts` to serve `/get-remote-cams-data`. Since the user specifically requested the route to be `/get-remote-cams-data`, we will place it dynamically at `app/get-remote-cams-data+api.ts`.
- **Parsing Library**: We will continue using `fast-xml-parser` to parse the `camaras_datex2_v36.xml` feed, ensuring compatibility with the exact structure and keys that `scripts/fetch-webcams.ts` has successfully utilized.
- **Testing Strategy**: We will use Jest to unit test the API route's internal parsing logic. We will mock the DGT XML response and verify that the transformation logic correctly produces the expected `WebcamData` objects and handles malformed inputs. Tests will be located adjacent to the route file or in a `__tests__` directory.

## Risks / Trade-offs

- **Risk: DGT Rate / Request Denial** → Mitigation: Initially, we will act as a pass-through. If DGT denies requests due to traffic volume in the future, we may need to introduce an in-memory or Redis caching layer in a subsequent change.
- **Risk: Parsing Overhead** → Mitigation: API routes might experience slight cold starts on some deployment platforms, and parsing a large XML file could add ~500ms-1s overhead compared to standard statically-served JSON. This trade-off is accepted for real-time capability.
